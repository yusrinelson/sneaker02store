        <h3>
            With the 40th Anniversary of the Nike Air Force 1 just around the corner, we wanted to take you back to where it all
            started.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Culturally accepted worldwide amongst athletes and everyday society, the Nike Air Force 1 is undoubtedly one of
            the Beaverton brand's greatest sneaker silhouettes of all time. The shoe first took flight in 1982 as a court shoe,
            boasting Nike Air technology. Named after the President of America's private plane, this shoe offered both protection
            and flight. Designed by Bruce Kilgore, the Nike Air Force 1 continues to be popular amongst sneaker purists and everyday
            wearers to this day. Besides Air technology the sneakers boasted new and innovative features such as a cup sole,
            exceeding durability within an athlete's gameplay. A threaded outsole also helped basketballers movements so they could
            fulfil their sporting potential.
        <br>
        <br>
            Similar to drop culture today, the Air Force 1 was initially released in a ‘run,’ meaning a limited time of which the
            shoe was available on store shelves. Once they were gone, they were gone. This meant as an owner, acquiring a pair
            gave you top tier status and bragging rights within an emerging sneaker culture.
        <br>
        <br>
            The relationship between music and
            sport, specifically hip-hop and basketball within New York, in the 80s and 90s, had an ever-lasting effect on the
            connection between sneakers and consumers. Nicknamed the “Uptowns” amongst inner-city youth, especially in Harlem,
            New York, the AF1 continues to release head-turning colourways, with eye-catching colour blocking schemes. The
            sneaker is especially important to the city of Baltimore; when Nike was planning to stop producing the shoe in ’84,
            the residents helped it live on. The community was later rewarded in 2017 with a “For Baltimore” release that pays
            homage to their efforts which essentially helped it live on to become a classic. Walking down any street, in any
            city, you are bound to spot a pair of white on white AF1 Lows within a matter of seconds. A timeless silhouette with
            a cult like status. A sneaker which is essential to any footwear rotation.
        <br>
        <br>
            Thanks to collaborations the value behind
            sneakers still continues to drive an ever-growing market. The Scarr’s Pizza x Nike Air Force 1 collaboration,
            designed in 2019 by DJ Clark Kent was another coveted pair of sneakers rumoured to have only around 48 pairs made.
            If you were lucky enough to make it on “the list” amongst Scarr’s Pizza friends & family, you could now own a pair
            of sneakers worth over $100,000. From collaborations with the likes of Supreme, atmos and Playstation, there are
            plenty of rare releases for serious sneaker collectors. In a recent Sotheby’s auction we saw a pair of 2009, Nike
            Air Force 1 ‘Entourage x Undefeated x Fukijama Gold’ sell for a staggering $88,200, proving the model’s 40 year
            tenure is still very much in demand amongst sneaker enthusiasts and pop-culture enthusiasts.

            An ultimate canvas. The
            Nike Air Force 1 is crisper than ever. 2022 is going to be a big year for the Air Force 1, with plenty of new models
            set to hit the shelves. With the re-emergence of the AF1 Mid, this can only be seen as the beginning of a big year
            for the style. The recent Air Force 1 Sculpt pays homage to the AF1s first release on the courts back in 1982, we
            recently visited father and daughter duo Chris Bramble and Freya Bramble-Carter, read here. Shop the latest styles
